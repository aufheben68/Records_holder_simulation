# Records_holder_simulation
One of my first C programs, built in 2013.

It's a simple program that holds records of citizens in a queue(using a particular format

e.g: newCitizen Manwlis, Antwnopoulos, 27/06/1978, 271-1102030, manwlis@uop.com, 147.27.32.15:9535, birthCert, 79927-39871-3)

and checks for the validity of the inputs. Then it can serve citizens in order of their insertion, print them out (normal and in reverse) or delete them.

It can also save insertions on a file and take inputs from an already existing file.
