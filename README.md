# Records_holder_simulation
One of my first C programs, built in 2013.

It's a simple program that holds records in a particular format

(e.g: newCitizen Manwlis, Antwnopoulos, 27/06/1978, 271-1102030, manwlis@uop.com, 147.27.32.15:9535, birthCert, 79927-39871-3)

and checks for the validity of the inputs. Then it can print them out or delete them.
